# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis

####  Beks foundation wants to utilize machine learning and neural networks to help the foundation predict where to make investments. With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks acquired, the features in the provided dataset will be used to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
####  From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
#### Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
